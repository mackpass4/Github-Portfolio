  <p> <br> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; My name is Mackenzie Pass, and I am a beginner in creative coding. I have a passion for philosophy and art, and I have created multi-media content for years. I have always had an interest philosophically about the process creators undergo when tranforming ideas into tangiable, viewable, content. Therefore, creative coding has allowed me to peel back a layer and understand the process that goes into creating digital art.
  <br> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; I would describe my aesthetic as minimalistic, and explorative. I believe the process of creating is more important that the finished product, and I feel as if some of my pieces speak to that. </p>
